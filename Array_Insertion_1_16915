/* Consider a physical trainer is arranging the students for physical training in a school.
There are N students standing in a row for physical training. He wants to insert a student with
average height between the two students who are having odd height standing in consecutive. 
Write a program for a physical trainer so that he can get the desired sequence of students.
Example: if the 5 students are having values: 3 6 5 9 7 then 5 and 9 are the students with
odd height so the student with height 7 (average of 5 and 9) should be inserted between 5 and 9.
Similarly, 9 and 7 are the 2 students with odd heights so student with height 8 should be inserted between 9 and 7.
Output: 3 6 5 7 9 8 7
Input Format
The first line will be containing one Integer representing a number of students N.
The second line will contain N integers representing the heights of the students.
Constraints
N>2 && N<20
Output Format
The desired sequence of students after inserting students having the average height of two students with odd height standing in consecutive in between them.
